Slipping my way through the cracks
And I hope you don't overreact when my body collapses
I've been wandering hoping to find my own place on this planet
I've been up in the middle of it, I've been up in the middle of it
In the middle earth, I've been nothing but real with you
I've been nothing but real with you

Is honesty overrated?
How many times have I said the same
The same thing in new ways?
Start to think it's the way that my life's gonna be
And I guess that's okay
Wanted to be a grunge singer when I was child
Grew up fast and wild
Now the crow's feet are crawling all over my face
Every time that I smile
What you know about being decapitated
While your body still rolls around aimlessly?
Is there a way for me to face my infinite demons
And maintain a sense of stability?
Hustling for pennies like I was still 14
I ain't ready to grow up
"Just wasn't made for these times"
Realize I will never blow up and that's fine
I'm not Cobain or Cornell or Layne
I'm just floating inside my own lane
Every word that I'm singing is plain
Just hoping that someone out there can relate
And there's times when I hate my brain
Want to drive directly into trees
Think of 6 million ways to stop breathing
When my heart is pounding from the anxiety
Every year it gets sadder and fatter
Till the point that you realize none of it matters much
For the minutes we have on this planet we're seeking love
And that's more than enough
Call it what you want
Call it God, call it your freedom
That connection between living beings is a powerful thing
And that's real to us
